# 8-Queens-problem
This Java program solves the 8 queens problem. A player specifies where they would like 1 queen to be placed  on an 8x8 chess board. The algorithm finds all the possible combinations of the other 7 queens that can happen with the specified placement.
This was made in Eclipse, but any Java IDE should run this.
