# 8-Queens-problem
This Java program solves the 8 queens problem. A player specifies where they would like 1 queen to be placed  on an 8x8 chess board. The algorithm will find all the possible combinations with another 7 queens, where the 8 queens cannot take each other.
This was made in Eclipse, but any Java IDE should run this.
